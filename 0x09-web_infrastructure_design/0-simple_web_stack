Explanation of Components
 What is a server?
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services to other computers (clients). In this case, it's a Linux machine with a full web stack.

 What is the role of the domain name?
A domain name like foobar.com is a human-readable address that maps to the server’s IP address. It allows users to access the website without remembering the server’s IP.

 What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
www is a DNS A record (Address record) that maps the subdomain www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

 What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?
The web server (Nginx):

Receives incoming HTTP(S) requests

Serves static files (e.g. HTML, images)

Forwards dynamic requests to the application server

Acts as a reverse proxy

 What is the role of the application server?
The application server (e.g. Gunicorn for Python):

Executes backend code (e.g. Django, Flask, PHP)

Handles business logic

Communicates with the database to process dynamic data

 What is the role of the database (MySQL)?
The database:

Stores persistent data (e.g. user accounts, blog posts)

Provides structured access to data via SQL queries

Responds to read/write requests from the application server

 What is the server using to communicate with the user’s computer?
The server communicates with the user's computer via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol over the internet (TCP/IP networking).

 Problems with this Infrastructure
❗ SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
Only one server: if it crashes or is attacked, the whole website goes down.

❗ Downtime during maintenance
If you restart the web or app server to deploy updates, users will experience downtime.

❗ Cannot scale under high traffic
If traffic increases (many users at once), this single server cannot handle the load.

You cannot horizontally scale (add more servers) with this setup.
